# 🌌 Galaxy Particle System in Three.js

This project is an experimental particle system built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), inspired by various tutorials I've followed. The main goal is to simulate a dynamic **galaxy-like environment** using configurable particles.

## ✨ About the Project

The galaxy is made entirely using a custom particle system, where you can interact with and control:

- Number of particles
- Color palette and gradients
- Size of particles
- Galaxy shape parameters

The system is rendered in real-time and responds to changes smoothly, giving a visually appealing result that represents a simplified galaxy simulation.

## 🔧 Features

- Adjustable number of particles (from sparse to dense)
- Customizable color gradients and themes
- Interactive controls (via Debug UI or GUI)
- Smooth animations using shaders or material blending
- Lightweight and runs in browser

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- GLSL (optional, for shader control if used)
- dat.GUI or lil-gui (for interactive controls)

## 📂 Other Particle Projects

Particles are one of my favorite concepts in creative development, and I've created several other projects with particle systems. However, most of them are not open-source.

You can see those private projects featured on my **portfolio website**:
